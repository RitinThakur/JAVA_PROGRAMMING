/**
 * Program Name: P4
 * Package: pattern
 *
 * Description:
 * This program prints uppercase alphabets sequentially from 'A' to 'D'
 * on a single line, separated by spaces.
 *
 * Concept Used:
 * - Character data type and ASCII manipulation
 * - Incrementing character values using 'ch++'
 * - for loop and System.out.print() for inline output
 *
 * Explanation:
 * 1Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize a character variable `ch` with 'A'.
 * 2Ô∏è‚É£ Use a for loop that iterates from 1 to 4 (i.e., four times).
 * 3Ô∏è‚É£ In each iteration:
 *     - Print the current character.
 *     - Increment the character (`ch++`) to get the next alphabet.
 * 4Ô∏è‚É£ Since System.out.print() is used, all alphabets appear on the same line.
 *
 * Output:
 * A B C D
